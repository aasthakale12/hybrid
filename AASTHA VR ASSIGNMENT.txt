ASSIGNMENT


Task 1: Setting Up Your Unity Project & Configuring the VR Environment
Step 1: Installing Unity Hub and Unity Editor
Download Unity Hub: Start by downloading and installing Unity Hub.
Install Unity Editor: After setting up Unity Hub, install Unity Editor version 2021.3.12f1 by choosing it from the available versions list.
Step 2: Creating a New Unity Project
Open Unity Hub: Launch Unity Hub and navigate to the "Projects" tab.
Create a New Project:
Click on the New Project button.
Choose the 3D Core Render Pipeline template.
Give your project a meaningful name.
Set Editor Version: Before creating, ensure that the Unity version 2021.3.12f1 is selected.
Create the Project: Once everything is set, click Create Project.
Step 3: Installing Required Packages
Open Package Manager: Once your project is set up, go to Window → Package Manager.
Access Unity Registry: In the Package Manager, switch to the "Unity Registry" tab to browse available packages.
Search for XR Interaction Toolkit:
Type "XR Interaction Toolkit" into the search bar.
Install the latest version.
If the latest version is unavailable, manually install it:
Copy the package name.
Click on the + icon and select Add package by name.
Paste the name and hit Add.
Enable New Input System: A prompt will appear asking if you want to enable the new Input System. Click Yes.
Step 4: Importing Starter Assets and Device Simulator
Install Starter Assets: Go to the Samples section under the XR Interaction Toolkit package and import the Starter Assets.
Install XR Device Simulator: Similarly, import the XR Device Simulator from the Samples section.

Task 2: Creating the Ground Plane
Step 5: Importing Assets from the Unity Asset Store
Download Low Poly Nature Pack:
Head over to the Unity Asset Store and search for "Low Poly Nature Pack."
Click Add to My Assets and then Open in Unity.
Import the Asset: Once it’s downloaded, click Import to bring the pack into your project.
Step 6: Setting Up the Scene with Low Poly Nature
Open Low Poly Nature Scene:
In the Project window, go to Assets → Low Poly Nature → Scenes.
Drag the Demo Scene into your Hierarchy window.
Duplicate and Edit the Scene:
Select the Demo Scene and press Ctrl + D to duplicate it.
Rename this copy and move it to your Sample Scene for editing.

Task 3: Adding a Skybox
Step 7: Importing a Skybox from the Unity Asset Store
Download a Skybox Asset:
Open the Asset Store from Window → Asset Store.
Search for a Skybox pack that suits your project.
Once you find one, click Add to My Assets.
Import Skybox into Unity:
After adding it to your assets, click Open in Unity to open the Package Manager.
In the Package Manager, click Download (if needed) and then Import to add the Skybox to your project.
Apply Skybox to Your Scene:
Go to Edit → Render Settings → Skybox Material.
In the Project window, find the Skybox material you imported and drag it into the Skybox Material field under Lighting Settings.

Task 6: Configuring Lighting and Shadows
Step 8: Lighting Settings
Open Lighting Settings: Go to Window → Rendering → Lighting → Settings.
Enable Baked Global Illumination: Ensure this is checked and select your preferred lighting mode (e.g., Baked Indirect).
Set Environment Lighting:
You can either use the Skybox for ambient lighting or choose a custom color under the Environment Lighting section.
Enable Real-Time Shadows: Go to Quality Settings and set the Shadow Resolution to High.
Adjust the Directional Light:
In the Hierarchy, select your Directional Light.
Set its Mode to Mixed or Real-time, and choose Soft Shadows.
Bake Lighting: Once you're satisfied with your setup, click Generate Lighting in the Lighting Settings window to bake the lights and shadows for static objects.

Task 7: Adding Audio
Step 9: Importing and Adding Audio to Your Scene
Download an Audio Asset:
Open the Asset Store (Window → Asset Store).
Search for an audio pack that fits your scene.
After selecting, click Add to My Assets.
Open Audio Pack in Unity: Once it’s added to your assets, click Open in Unity. This will open the Package Manager.
Import the Audio Pack: Download the asset (if needed) and import it into your project.
Access Audio Files: Once imported, the audio files will appear in your Project window under a new folder (e.g., Assets → AudioPack).
Add Audio to Your Scene:
To add audio, drag the audio file from the Project window into your Hierarchy.
Unity will automatically create an Audio Source component for the audio file.

Task 9: Write the VR Interaction Script
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class VRMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 3.0f;                // Speed of player movement
    public float rotationSpeed = 100.0f;      // Speed of rotation

    private CharacterController characterController;
    private Transform cameraTransform;        // Main camera to determine forward direction

    void Start()
    {
        characterController = GetComponent<CharacterController>();   // Get the Character Controller
        cameraTransform = Camera.main.transform;                     // Get the main camera transform
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Movement input (W, A, S, D or arrow keys)
        float moveForward = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");    // W/S or Up/Down arrow keys
        float moveRight = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");    // A/D or Left/Right arrow keys

        // Calculate movement direction relative to the camera's forward direction
        Vector3 direction = cameraTransform.forward * moveForward + cameraTransform.right * moveRight;
        direction.y = 0;  // Disable vertical movement (so it doesn't fly)

        // Apply movement
        characterController.Move(direction * speed * Time.deltaTime);

        // Rotation input (Q, E or arrow keys)
        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Q))                      // Rotate left
        {
            transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, -rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        }
        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.E))                      // Rotate right
        {
            transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        }
    }
}
